Chat application build on top of GitHub API. It was build in 24 hours during Berlin LinkedIn

Hackathon (October 2012).

We are using [GitHub Issues API](http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/) and [web hooks](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/).

After receiving webhook server code will broacast message to other people in the room.


# Protocol

Protocol is super simple:

  * github issue is a room.
  * github issue comment is a message inside the room.


# Tools

Build using Node.js, Socket.io, jQuery. Hosted on [nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com).


# Demo

Checkout this [Berlin Hackathon Room](http://chat.gitrun.com/room/gitrun/chat/4) for chat room of hackers.

Or you can try it by downloading code locally and running it with following commands:

```
 npm install
 node server.js
```
Then just open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

Note that real-time updates will not work since web hooks will not work with local servers.


# Features

Thich chat app has following cool features:

  * desktop notifications
  * email notifications
  * real-time updates (you get all new messages in room immediately)
  * multiple rooms support
  * unlimited amount of users inside the room
  * private rooms support (just create an issue in private repository)

# How to

To create new chat room just create some issue in your own repostory.
Then just type following url in browser:

```

```
where:
  * `#{USER_NAME}` - username of orgnisation name that holds the GitHub repo where you created issue.
  * `#{REPO_NAME}` - GitHub repo name where you created issue.
  * `#{ISSUE_ID}` - id of issue you just created on GitHub. It's the last token of URL for that issue.
