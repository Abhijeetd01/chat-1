[![Chat](http://chat.gitrun.com/images/gitchat-badge.svg)](http://chat.gitrun.com/room/gitrun/chat/17)

Chat application build on top of GitHub API. It was build in 24 hours during Berlin LinkedIn

Hackathon (October 2012).

We are using [GitHub Issues API](http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/) and [web hooks](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/).

After receiving webhook server code will broacast message to other people in the room.


# Protocol

Protocol is super simple:

  * github issue is a room.
  * github issue comment is a message inside the room.


# Tools

Build using Node.js, Socket.io, jQuery. Hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


# Demo

Checkout this [Berlin Hackathon Room](http://chat.gitrun.com/room/gitrun/chat/4) for chat room of hackers.

Or you can try it by downloading code locally and running it with following commands:

```
 npm install
 npm start
```
Then just open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

Note that real-time updates will not work since web hooks will not work with local servers.


# Run yourself locally

If you want to run this app locally do following:

```
  git clone https://github.com/gitrun/chat/
  cd chat
  npm install
```  

There is a configuration file with GitHub clientID and clientSecret in the `configs/development.config.json`.
You can keep it as is and just run `npm start`. It will use default GitHub app created by me.

You can also create your own GitHub application on https://github.com/settings/developers. Please specify callback URL as http://localhost:3000/auth/callback and copy new clientID and clientSecret into the `configs/development.config.json`.

Run `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000/`.
You can verify that everything works if you can open `http://localhost:3000/room/gitrun/chat/4` and click "Join!" button in the top right corner.


# Run yourself on Heroku

If you want to run this app on Heroku do following:

```
  git clone https://github.com/gitrun/chat/
  cd chat
  npm install
```  

There is a configuration file with GitHub clientID and clientSecret in the `configs/development.config.json`.
You can keep it as is and proceed further or you can also create your own GitHub application on https://github.com/settings/developers. Please copy new clientID and clientSecret into the `configs/development.config.json`.

In order to continue with Heroku you need to install [Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up).
Then in the chat directory do `heroku create` as mentioned [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app) and then `git push heroku master`.
At this point Heroku will create new URL for your app (something like http://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/). If you decided to use your own GitHub App you need to update callback URL to the one created by Heroku. Please update this URL in both `configs/development.config.json` and on GitHub settings page for your application.


# Features

Chat app has following cool features:

  * desktop notifications
  * email notifications
  * real-time updates (you get all new messages in room immediately)
  * multiple rooms support
  * unlimited amount of users inside the room
  * private rooms support (just create an issue in private repository)

# How to

To create new chat room just create new issue in your own repository.
Then just type following url in browser:

```
  http://chat.gitrun.com/room/#{USER_NAME}/#{REPO_NAME}/#{ISSUE_ID}
```
where:
  * `#{USER_NAME}` - username of orgnisation name that holds the GitHub repo where you created issue.
  * `#{REPO_NAME}` - GitHub repo name where you created issue.
  * `#{ISSUE_ID}` - id of issue you just created on GitHub. It's the last token of URL for that issue.
